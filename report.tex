\begin{abstract}
This document presents an end-to-end AI-powered fintech platform designed to predict borrower credit risk. Traditional underwriting processes are often rigid and lack transparency. Our system introduces a machine learning-driven architecture for rapid prediction of default probabilities and an automated decision support framework for formulating professional lending recommendations. Using a Random Forest classifier combined with robust preprocessing, the system accurately classifies high-risk and low-risk candidates while prioritizing critical metrics such as Recall and ROC-AUC for financial stability.

\section{Introduction}
Traditional credit underwriting relies heavily on static scorecards and rigid, rule-based systems. These legacy systems often fail to adapt to complex financial behaviors and lack transparency into why an applicant was rejected. 

The purpose of this platform is to solve the manual bottleneck in modern fintech by introducing a system that can continuously learn from historical data. The architecture enables scaling loan origination, reducing human underwriting time, and maintaining explainable compliance standards through an integrated ML scoring and automated reporting approach.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset Description}
The project utilizes a Credit Risk Benchmark Dataset representing historical profiles of borrowers. Key features include age, monthly income, number of dependents, utilization of credit limits (Revolving Utilization), debt ratios, and historical repayment behavior. The target variable constitutes a binary flag indicating whether a borrower hit delinquency within a 2-year window.

\subsection{Preprocessing \& Engineering}
To maintain dataset integrity, missing values in numerical features were handled via automated median imputation, staying robust to extreme outliers typical in income data. Variables are uniformly scaled to prepare for model ingestion.

\subsection{System Architecture}
The basic architecture of the integrated scoring system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:arch}. It follows a linear pipeline from ingestion to risk classification.

    \label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Modeling Algorithm}
The primary model is a \texttt{RandomForestClassifier}. Unlike simple decision trees, this ensemble method improves generalization. The model calculates the predicted class $\hat{y}$ for an applicant $x$ by aggregating the predictions from $B$ individual decision trees $T_b$:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{y} = \text{mode} \{ T_1(x), T_2(x), \dots, T_B(x) \}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the default probability $P(Y=1 | X)$ is estimated as the mean predicted probability across the ensemble:
\begin{equation}
    P(Y=1 | X) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} P_b(Y=1 | X)
\end{equation}

To combat class imbalance, the system uses the \texttt{class\_weight="balanced"} hyperparameter with 100 base estimators.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
The model was validated using an 80/20 train-test split. The results demonstrate robust separation ability:

\midrule

Precision & 0.7750 \\
Recall & 0.7750 \\
ROC-AUC & 0.8531 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Feature Importance (XAI)}
The Random Forest model inherently estimates the importance of each feature. Figure \ref{fig:importance} provides a visualization of the top factors.

    \label{fig:importance}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
The quantitative results highlight a critical trade-off in credit risk modeling: the balance between precision and recall. In a lending environment, a False Negative (failing to identify a default) is significantly more costly than a False Positive. By utilizing balanced class weights, our model achieves a recall of 0.775, ensuring that the majority of high-risk applicants are successfully flagged.

The use of Random Forest also provides essential transparency through feature importance. Financial regulations often require lenders to provide a "Statement of Reasons" for denying credit. Our system automates this by identifying the primary drivers—such as Revolving Utilization—which serves as a proxy for financial stress. This bridge between mathematical modeling and practical decision-making ensures that the system is not a "black box," but an interpretable tool for credit analysts.

Furthermore, the ROC-AUC score of 0.85 indicates that the model has strong discriminative power across varying probability thresholds, allowing for adjustable risk-appetite settings based on current economic conditions.

\section{Conclusion}
This system demonstrates the practical viability of using ensemble machine learning for automated fintech scoring. By achieving strong ROC-AUC performance and providing structured, explainable decision support, the platform sets a modern standard for efficient and interpretable credit underwriting.
