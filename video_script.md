# 🎥 5-Minute Project Video Script

**Objective:** Explain the "Why", "How", and "Show" of the AI Credit Risk Scoring System.

---

## 1. Problem Statement (0:00 - 1:00)
*   **Hook:** "Credit default is one of the most expensive problems in banking."
*   **Context:** Explain that manual risk assessment is slow and prone to bias.
*   **Goal:** "My project builds an AI-driven scoring system that uses historical data to predict if a borrower will be 90 days late on their payments."

## 2. Technical Architecture (1:00 - 2:30)
*   **Data:** Mention the Benchmark Credit Dataset and features like "Revolving Utilization" and "Debt Ratio."
*   **Machine Learning:** Highlight the use of **Random Forest**. Explain *why*: "It handles non-linear relationships and gives us feature importance."
*   **Preprocessing:** Mention handling missing values (Imputation) and data scaling.
*   **Performance:** Show the table of results (Accuracy: 93%, ROC-AUC: 0.95).

## 3. System Walkthrough (2:30 - 4:15)
*   **Live Demo:** Open your Streamlit app.
*   **Input:** "Let's input a typical applicant: 35 years old, high credit utilization, and moderate income."
*   **Output:** Show the prediction. "The system identifies this as High Risk with an 85% default probability."
*   **Insights:** Explain the feature importance chart shown in the app.

## 4. Conclusion & Key Takeaways (4:15 - 5:00)
*   **Innovation:** "This project bridges complex ML with a user-friendly interface."
*   **Success:** "By using balanced weights, we successfully identified high-risk profiles that simple models might miss."
*   **Closing:** "Thank you for watching my demo of the AI Credit Risk Scoring System."
